## This is the first release of the 'test_compression' project.
##
## The purpose of this project is to provide a unified framework
## for testing annd demonstration of various compression/decompression libraries.
##
## This install includes the source code to the following open source projects.
##
##  BZIP
##  CRYPTOPP
##  MINILZO
##  ZLIB
##
## Please read and honor the licenses for each and every one of these
## libraries!  This project is provided only as an educational tool
## on how to integrate various compression libraries into your
## application.
##
## All of the various compressors can be accessed via a single simple
## API interface which you can find in the director called 'compression'
## and by including the header file 'compression.h'
##
## The reason there are so many warnings in the build is because it
## makes use of various source code libraries that are not warning safe.
##
